## Comments:
The article provides a good overview of GoLang and its use in building Blockchain applications in particular. The article discusses several reasons why GoLang is superior to other blockchain development languages. To summarize, the author believes GoLang stands out because of its simple syntax, speed, and efficiency. Even though I have no prior knowledge of GoLang, I believe these three characteristics make it a must-use language for developers. As well as this, the author mentions that GoLang is built for distributed systems. Therefore, many Go applications can handle millions of requests as opposed to PHP applications.  Go's ability to run a lot of functions in parallel allows it to be run on distributed systems - a primary requirement of blockchain applications.
In addition, this article introduces some of the blockchain tools built using GoLang, as well as some coding examples. Furthermore, it states that Go is a compiled language - hence, it runs directly on the OS. This can allow us to build technology like EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) in a much better way. In summary, this articles really allows me to see the power of GoLang in the world or blockchain development and I highly recommend everyone interested in GoLang or Blockchain check out.
